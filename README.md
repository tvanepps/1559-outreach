**Summary**

To continue the work started in October 2020 ([EIP-1559 Community Outreach Report](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/eip-1559-community-outreach-report-aa18be0666b5)), we have gathered additional sentiment on EIP-1559 from leading Ethereum applications. Because the success of the Ethereum ecosystem is tightly linked to its builders, it's important to catalog their perspectives for Core Devs to consider as part of their process.

Outreach started on Jan 25 with the top 10 ranking of DeFiPulse Total Value Locked (TVL). Sentiment gathering and education is ongoing. We have also added projects that signaled via [SupportEIP1559.org](https://supporteip1559.org/) to this repo.

Collectively, these applications represents over $21B in value locked. (as of Feb. 23, 2021)

If you would like to add or update a position, please add an issue to the repo with:

- org name
- link to a public source

**Disclaimers**

1. In most cases, the responses only represent the opinion of Core teams, not that of each application's community. 
2. Note that just because a team is not represented here, that doesn't mean they are against the proposal.
